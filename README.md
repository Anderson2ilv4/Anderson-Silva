# ðŸ’»Anderson Silva


I'm a self-taught software engineer, I'm getting a degree in a software engineering course but it's online, and if I want to learn, I have to study hard by myself, I'm creating some content on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anderson-silva-717179166/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anderson_josse/) and recently I started creating some content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVT2PoI_I8i9HQjYfFFwTMA) too, I don't want to be famous but it's a way that I use to practice and learn something, when I try to teach something I'm able to get some more expertise on that, so that is the reason I'm creating, if some company find me by that it would be good, so take a look at my GitHub profile!!
